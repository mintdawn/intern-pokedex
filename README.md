This is a project that meets some challenges set forth by a company I am applying for an internship with. The objective is to make a Pokedex that fulfills all the requirements the company has asked for.

#Requirements
* Get a paginated list of Pokemon from the API.
* Clicking a Pokemon card should load the detail view for that Pokemon.
* Number of Pokemon per row should change dynamically with the width of the screen.
* Next/Previous buttons should allow the user to store the current page number. When reloading the page, the correct page should be loaded and displayed.
* Search
** The new results should be fetched when the user presses enter.
** The search string should be stored in a query parameter.
* Each Pokemon detail page should have a unique URL.
* Back arrow should return the user to the list view.
* Standard web browser navigation controls (i.e. bac/forward) should be functional.
* For bonus points, use color thief to dynamically set the primary color used on the page depending on the Pokemon's picture.
